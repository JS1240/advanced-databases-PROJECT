## Presentation

<p>In the video you talk about the database preparation(backend), technique: including connection to the database and queries (frontend), results(PHP page), and reflection. You must explain with a good level of details and through a running example your developed artefact showing the code and its execution. 
Brief report background</p>

## Preparation
<p>For the creation of the front-end we are using PHP to send HTML (and CSS and JavaScript) to the browser, it really works well in computation on the server (and accessing a database, not on the user's computer). Not using PHP to focus on the client-side is just as bad as using it to generate only client-side code.</p>

## Reflection
<p>What are the limitations of the relational model in handling big data? Do you think the NoSQL models and technologies have succeeded in overcoming those limitations?</p>

Designers must consider SQL when your data is highly structured and doesn't change frequently.

For NoSQL, it is considered when data is mostly unstructured or semi-structured data that doesnt't fit the relational model
|SQL|NoSQL|Conclusion|
|---|---|---|
|Data is highly structured|Data is mostly unstructured/doesn't change frequently|Something useful|
